        <h1>Game Rules</h1>
        <p>This is a game that's inspired from <strong>The Simon Game</strong>, it is a classic memory game that challenges players to remember a series of colors and sounds in sequence. Here are the basic rules:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You will be given a sequence of colors and sounds in a specific order.</li>
          <li>Your goal is to repeat the sequence exactly as you were given.</li>
          <li>If you succeed, another color and sound will be added to the sequence.</li>
          <li>You must continue to repeat the sequence, which will grow longer and more challenging.</li>
          <li>If you make a mistake and repeat the sequence incorrectly, the game ends.</li>
          <li>The game will keep track of your high score until you refresh the page, so you can try to beat your best performance.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy the game and test your memory skills!</p>
